# Momentum-Senior-Capstone

A capstone project aimed to design and develop a personal health tracking and goal building mobile application. 

Our app's goal is to help unmotivated users in the precontemplation stage of health tracking to build incentive
through extrinsic motivation to maintain sustained use of our app, eventually turning that extrinsic motivation into intrinsic motivation. The app will give users freedom to develop their own goal routine, both daily and weekly, ranging from physical activity, mood, calories, sleep, water intake, etc.

Progress will be shown visually through a "glanceable display," taking the place of your phone's wallpaper, updating dynamically as goals are achieved. I.e., a tree that will grow leaves for every daily goal achieved and more substantial changes like a butterfly appearing when completely weekly goals.
